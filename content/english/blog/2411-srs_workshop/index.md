We had an great time attending srsRAN workshop 2024, presenting our work integrating srsRAN with onboard inference, and meeting the community of engineers, developers, and researchers who are advancing the cause of open source 5G, OpenRAN, and next generation telecommunications.

We were pleased to present our work on building our Radio Inference Applications on RAN (RIA RAN) platform to an audience of srsRAN users, as well as the opportunity to speak about OpenRAN as a platform for wireless research as part of a panel discussion. Recordings of both are linked below.



### Deploying Deep Learning Models for RF Signal Classification to the RAN

**Synopsis:** _This presentation explores the concept of OpenRAN distributed applications and new capabilities they can offer. We discuss how deep learning inference can be performed as close as possible to the software-defined radio, enabling low-latency processing directly on IQ streams. We propose a system for integrating a radiofrequency machine learning inference solution into an srsRAN base station. Preliminary results from this work will be presented, demonstrating its practical implications. The session will conclude with a discussion of near-term projects built on this architecture and an outline of future possibilities._
