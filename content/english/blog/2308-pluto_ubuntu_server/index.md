The [ADI ADALM Pluto](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto) is a great device for prototyping SDR solutions. It is compatible with [GNU Radio(https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/PlutoSDR_Source)], has a [python API](https://ez.analog.com/ez-blogs/b/engineerzone-spotlight/posts/using-python-to-control-the-pluto-radio-and-plot-data), and is a great utility that is readily commercially available. It is even the subject of a widely availible course on DSP, [pySDR](https://pysdr.org/content/pluto.html).

At Qoherent, we use it for all sorts of applications with all kinds of workstations. One common use case is with our portable ubuntu server systems.

Unfortunately, the Pluto SDR doesnt automatically connect to ubuntu server. The Pluto SDR it is a USB device that emulates an ethernet conenction, and ubuntu server does not let USB devices install themselves automatically.

To overcome this, we have put together the following guide.

## Finding the pluto

To get it set up, first verify the pluto is connected via **lsusb**:

```bash
lsusb
```

With the pluto plugged in run ```ip link show```:

```bash
ip link show
```

Take note of what is shown. Unplug the pluto then run it again. Note the parameters that are missing. Run ```ip lonk show``` again.

```bash
ip link show
```

Plug it in again then run ```ip link show``` it one more time to see the new connection.

Note the name of the interface - in this case **enx00e022f21353**

## Setting up the new connection.

Manually set ifconfig for **enx00e022f21353**.

```bash
sudo ifconfig enx00e022f21353 192.168.3.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```
Make special note to use the same IP subnet of your pluto (this one is set to the default of 192.168.3.1, so any IP on 192.168.3.x will do).

run ```ifconfig``` again to see that the new interface exists.

```bash
ifconfig
```

test with a ping

```bash
ping 192.168.3.1
```

if it returns a result, you are good to go!

NOTE, this method will NOT persist across reboots. To do that, do the following method:


```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/02-usb-device.yaml
```
add these contents:
 

```bash
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enx00e022f21353:  # use your correct interface name here
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.3.2/24]
```

 

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

```bash
ping 192.168.3.1
```
