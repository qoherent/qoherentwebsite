Qoherent will be attending IEEE Milcom 2024 on October 28, 2024 to present our updates to openRAN work with srsRAN and RIA RAN as part of the 5G working group. Our presentation is titled _"Deploying Deep Learning Models for Radio Frequency Signal Classification to the RAN with srsRAN"_ and in the presentation we discuss models we have trained in the past year for deployment onto the RAN, to enable RAN control and RAN-sensing.
