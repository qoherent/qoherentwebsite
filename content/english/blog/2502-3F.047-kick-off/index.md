Qoherent recently kicked off a new CSA supported, co-funded ESA ARTES activity, with a special focus on 5G NTN. The project, code 3F.047, named _"ML-based Dense Area RF Resource Management for Open source 5G-NTN systems"_ explores the use of AI for dynamic radio resource management.

The project is breifly touched on in our presentation during the srsRAN workshop, in the video below.

If you are interested in learning about the project, [please contact us](/contact). More updates will be provided as the project progresses.
