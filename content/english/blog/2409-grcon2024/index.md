We had the pleasure of attending and sponsoring 2024's GNU RADIO CONFERENCE, held in Knoxville, Tennessee.

At GRCON there was a lot of hype around AI, Intelligent RAN, Non-Terrestrial Networks, and more.

We reconnected with colleagues from across the industry to talk about opportunities for AI in wireless communications and RF sensing, and even shared some demos of the tools we use within RIA Hub.

Overall it was a great event and we are happy to participate in the community.
