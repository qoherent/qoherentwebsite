Following a successful AI mission last year, we were pleased to be selected to join a delegation of Canadian companies to participate in the 2025 Canada-UK Space Inward Mission.

On our trip we toured satellite production sites in southern England, toured ESA's 5G hub at ECSAT, and attended the Farnborough International Space Show.

We are looking forward to exploring applications of onboard AI on NTN's across the growing space industry in the UK.
