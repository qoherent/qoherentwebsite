## Develop Radio Inference Applications with Qoherent 

Applying machine learning to RF systems requires advanced expertise at the intersection of wireless communications engineering, digital signal processing, and artificial intelligence. Qoherent develops functional prototypes of Radio Inference Applications that validate technical concepts, establish clear feasibility, and define a pathway to production deployment. Our goal is to increase your Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from concept to working prototype, providing the evidence needed for further development investment.
