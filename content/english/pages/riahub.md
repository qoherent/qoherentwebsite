_**Radio Intelligence Apps Hub (RIA Hub)**_ by Qoherent is an AI development platform for software-defined radios, designed for radio signal processing engineers and researchers in wireless technologies. RIA accelerates intelligent radio development by significantly reducing integration between stages, allowing a sharper focus on innovation. The platform streamlines dataset creation, algorithm design, and model deployment, enhancing productivity and reducing project timelines. Built on a foundation of open-source accessibility, a comprehensive IP library, and automation capabilities, *RIA drives the creation of intelligent radios*, unlocking solutions in an increasingly congested and challenged wireless spectrum.


#### End-to-end workflow for deploying machine learning into software-defined radios
- Supports signal generation in python, GNU Radio and MATLAB as well as controlling a SDR testbeds for over-the-air emulation.
- Automated design and training for producing high performance models.
- Interoperable with several popular signal processing and deep learning back ends.
- Social, community, and collaboration features for sharing models and datasets with colleagues or to a community
- Automated testing, integration, and deployment into SDR-enabled systems, including OpenRAN-ready 5G solutions.
- Deployment of models to a range of SDR-enabled targets.

#### Comprehensive reference library
- Includes popular off-the-shelf deep learning algorithms, adapted for radio applications.
- Open Source and community libraries.
- Synthesizers, recordings, pre-trained models, and API's for accelerating the time to prototype.
