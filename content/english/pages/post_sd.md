## Summary

Qoherent seeks a *Software Developer* to participate in development of RIAHub, our end-to-end platform for software-defined radio machine learning. RIAHub enables the complete workflow: problem formulation, dataset production, model production, compression, application packaging, testing, and deployment-with potential for agentic components. The successful candidate will focus on RIAHub as their primary responsibility, refactoring and building upon existing utilities while maintaining focus on usability and reliability.

This is a full-time, hybrid position requiring 2-3 days on-site per week, combining remote flexibility with in-person collaboration in downtown Toronto. Benefits include dental, health and vision coverage, professional development opportunities, exposure to AI and SDR technologies, and the chance to work in a dynamic, early-stage startup culture.
