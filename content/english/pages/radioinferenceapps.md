The RIA Project, also known as "RIA Core" serves as the foundational core of RIA Hub, an extensive AI development platform designed for software-defined radios. RIA Core is the open-source set of utilities, features, and command-line scripts that power the RIA Hub.

RIA drives the creation of intelligent radios, unlocking solutions in an increasingly congested, contested, and complex wireless spectrum. 

For more details on RIA, visit the project's [github page](https://github.com/qoherent/ria).

RIA currently in the testing phase, you will soon be able to install it via pip:
