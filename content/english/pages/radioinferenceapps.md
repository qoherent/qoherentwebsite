The radio inference applications project, also known as "RIA" serves as the foundational core of RIA Hub, an extensive AI development platform designed for software-defined radios. RIA is the open-source set of utilities, features, and command-line scripts that power the RIA Hub.

RIA drives the creation of intelligent radios, unlocking solutions in an increasingly congested, contested, and complex wireless spectrum. Explore RIA on RIA Hub: [`https://riahub.ai/ria/ria`](https://riahub.ai/ria/ria).

RIA currently in the testing phase, you will soon be able to install it via pip:

```bash
pip install ria
```

To access the codebase, clone the ria repo directly:

```bash
git clone https://riahub.ai/ria/ria
```

Or, to start working on dataset capture and curation right away, consider the RIA Signal Testbed application (Coming soon)

```bash
git clone https://riahub.ai/ria/signal-testbed
```
