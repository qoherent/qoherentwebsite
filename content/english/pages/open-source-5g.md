# Open Source 5G Network Testing & Deployment

Private 5G networks offer new opportunities for secure, high-performance communications — but real-world adoption requires careful validation and robust integration.  

Qoherent delivers **end-to-end testing, deployment, and integration services** for open-source 5G platforms, combining Open RAN expertise, commercial-grade SDR hardware, and AI/ML integration for RAN control and joint communications and sensing (JCAS).

{{< notice "info" >}}
We partner directly with the **srsRAN** project and industry collaborators to advance Open RAN capabilities.  
Watch our work on [AI in 5G networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ0ak4I21qk) and learn about [RIA Hub](/riahub) or [RIA RAN](/intelligent-5g-ran) , our platform for deploying inference applications into the gNodeB.

## Deployment Services

We deploy both research-grade and small-scale, AI-enabled private 5G networks, from single-site testbeds to multi-node operational systems.


{{< accordion "Private Network Implementation" >}}
- **Core network**: 5G Core (5GC) or EPC deployment and configuration  
- **Radio access**: gNodeB/eNodeB installation, tuning, and optimisation  
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to existing IT and operational infrastructure  
- **Security**: Network segmentation, isolation, and access control policies  
{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Technology Stack" >}}
- **Software platforms**: srsRAN, OpenAirInterface, Open RAN frameworks, and custom modules  
- **Hardware**: USRP devices, other SDR platforms, and O-RU integration  
- **Deployment models**: On-premises labs, edge compute environments, and hybrid architectures
