Organizations exploring private 5G networks need expert support to validate use cases and deploy functional systems. We provide comprehensive 5G testing and deployment services using open-source platforms and commercial-grade SDR equipment.

## Testing Services

### Network Performance Validation
- Coverage mapping and range testing (indoor/outdoor environments)
- Throughput and latency characterization under real-world conditions
- Multi-UE capacity and handover performance
- Quality of Service (QoS) verification for critical applications

### Integration Testing
- Device compatibility validation
- Application-layer performance testing
- Coexistence analysis with existing wireless systems
- Edge computing integration scenarios

### Specialized Testing Scenarios
We've successfully tested unique 5G applications including:
- Drone-mounted relay networks achieving 1.5km range
- Underground mining communications
- Maritime and port operations
- Smart factory deployments with ultra-low latency requirements

## Deployment Services

### Private Network Implementation
Our team deploys complete private 5G networks tailored to your requirements:

- **Core Network**: 5G Core (5GC) or EPC configuration
- **Radio Access**: gNodeB/eNodeB deployment and optimization
- **Integration**: Connection to existing IT infrastructure
- **Security**: Network isolation and access control

### Technology Stack
- **Software Platforms**: srsRAN, OpenAirInterface
- **Hardware Support**: USRP platforms, commercial SDRs
- **Deployment Models**: On-premises, edge, hybrid architectures

## Engagement Models

We offer flexible engagement approaches based on your project needs:

- **Proof-of-Concept**: Rapid validation of 5G for your use case
