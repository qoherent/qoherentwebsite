# Custom RF Dataset Development

Building RF machine learning models requires high-quality training data. We specialize in creating custom datasets tailored to your specific requirements, drawing from our experience delivering 30+ datasets for space agencies and defense organizations.

## Our Approach

We handle the complete dataset development lifecycle - from initial requirements gathering through final delivery. Our team combines RF domain expertise with machine learning experience to ensure your datasets enable successful model development.

### Synthetic Dataset Generation

Our synthetic data capabilities cover a comprehensive range of RF environments:

- **Cellular Networks**: 5G NR, LTE, and legacy cellular standards across all deployment bands
- **Satellite Communications**: LEO, MEO, and GEO scenarios including interference modeling  
- **Industrial IoT**: ISM band protocols, LoRa, Sigfox, and proprietary formats
- **Radar Systems**: FMCW, pulse-Doppler, and specialized waveforms
- **Custom Protocols**: Your proprietary signals and modulation schemes

### Real-World Data Collection

When synthetic data isn't sufficient, we provide professional data collection services:

- Over-the-air capture using calibrated SDR equipment (50 MHz - 6 GHz)
- Controlled environment recordings with precise ground truth
- Multi-location collection for geographic and environmental diversity
- Interference and background characterization

## Delivery Standards

- **Industry Formats**: Full support for SigMF, HDF5, and custom formats
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Complete signal parameters, collection conditions, and labeling methodology
- **Quality Assurance**: Validated datasets with statistical analysis and example notebooks
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides for dataset usage and model training

## Representative Projects

Our dataset development experience spans multiple domains:

- Interference classification datasets for satellite operators
- Spectrum occupancy data for cognitive radio research  
- Device fingerprinting datasets for IoT security applications
- Modulation recognition data for signal intelligence systems

At Qoherent, we specialize in creating custom RF (Radio Frequency) datasets tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're training machine learning models, developing RF algorithms, or conducting research, our dataset development services can provide you with the high-quality data you require. 

We understand the importance of data interoperability. That's why we support industry-standard formats, including SIGMF, to ensure compatibility with your existing tools and workflows.

Whether you need a small dataset for a specific project or a massive dataset for large-scale experiments, we have the resources and expertise to handle dataset curation exercises of any scale.


## Dataset Synthesis

Our experts can generate synthetic RF datasets for a wide range of scenarios and applications, including:

- Space-based communications and sensing environments
- 5G, LTE, and standard cellular environments
- ISM band
- Radars
- Vehicular communications

Whether you need data for simulating wireless communication networks, IoT devices, or any other RF environment, Qoherent can help.

## Recording Capture and Curation

We offer comprehensive recording capture and curation services,  including:

- **Testbed design and development** - In addition to custom datasets, we can create emulators and testbeds using popular commercially available Software-Defined Radios (SDRs). This allows you to test your RF systems in controlled environments and evaluate their performance under various conditions. We can emulate any scenario we can synthesize (above).
- **Over the air** - We can build datasets based on recordings of recording ambient over-the-air data, by capturing relevant ambient signals in real-world scenarios, giving you access to real-world RF signals for research, analysis, and testing purposes. 
- **Labelling** - We offer both automated and human-led RF dataset labelling.

Our team utilizes state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the captured RF data.

Contact us today to discuss your custom RF dataset development needs. Our team is ready to work closely with you to create the ideal dataset that meets your design requirements.
