Qoherent is building the RIA Toolkit to make RIA development more accessible. The RIA Toolkit is a collection of software tools that support all stages of the RIA development lifecycle, including:
- Dataset generation, curation, and testing
- Model building, training, and evaluation
- Application integration, benchmarking, and deployment

The RIA Toolkit serves as the foundational building block for RIA solutions, including RIA Hub and RIA RAN.

The RIA Toolkit is available as a standalone Python library, or through RIA Hub.

### RIA Toolkit OSS

RIA Toolkit OSS is an open-source version of the RIA Toolkit, including the fundamental tools to get started developing, testing, and deploying radio intelligence applications. RIA Toolkit OSS is free and open-source, released under AGPLv3, although alternative permissive and commercial licensing options are available upon request. Please contact us for further details.

RIA Toolkit OSS is available as both a Conda package and a standard Python package. Conda packages are tested for compatibility with RadioConda, ensuring easy integration with GNU Radio and common SDR devices.

To get started with RIA Toolkit OSS, please refer to the project documentation, which includes instructions for installation via both Conda and pip.
