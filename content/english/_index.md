## Why Radio Intelligence?

Modern wireless systems face challenges that traditional DSP can’t solve:  
- **Crowded spectrum** that requires rapid, intelligent adaptation  
- **Complex interference** patterns in contested and shared bands  
- **Unknown or non-cooperative signals** that must be identified on the fly  
- **Performance trade-offs** that shift with changing conditions  

Machine learning has proven effective at addressing these challenges, enabling faster decisions, smarter resource allocation, and greater operational resilience.

**Radio intelligence is how we make it happen**, integrating inference-tuned models directly into SDR and 5G platforms to deliver actionable results in real-world conditions.


## Current Work

- **Research**: Driving innovation in next-generation wireless with AI
- **Services**: Helping organizations validate and deploy radio inference applications
- **RIA Hub**: Building tools to make RF ML development more accessible
- **Open Source**: Contributing to trailblazing projects such as srsRAN, GNU Radio, and IQ Engine


## Let's Build Intelligent Radios Together

Whether you require a prototype to evaluate a concept, a dataset to support research, assistance with private network deployment, or guidance on radio intelligence, we provide practical engineering support tailored to your RF requirements.
