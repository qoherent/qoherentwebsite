{{< notice "We work at the intersection of three disciplines:" >}}
- **Software-defined radio** – flexible RF hardware  
- **Machine learning** – algorithms that understand complex signals  
- **Tools to accelerate engineering** – bridging concept to working system faster

## Why Radio Intelligence?

Modern wireless systems face challenges that traditional DSP can’t solve alone:  
- **Crowded spectrum** requiring rapid, intelligent adaptation  
- **Complex interference** patterns in contested and shared bands  
- **Unknown or non-cooperative signals** that must be identified on the fly  
- **Performance trade-offs** that shift with changing conditions  

Machine learning can address these problems — enabling faster decisions, smarter resource allocation, and better resilience.  
**Radio intelligence is how we make that happen**, integrating inference models directly into SDR and 5G platforms to deliver actionable results in real deployments.


## Current Work

- **Intelligent RAN and 5G NTN Research** - Exploring the intersection of 5G, satellites, and AI.
- **Services**: Helping organizations validate and deploy radio inference applications
- **RIA Hub Development**: Building tools to make RF ML development more accessible
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the advancement of projects like srsRAN, GNU Radio, and IQ Engine
- **Research**: Continuing to advance radio inference techniques


## Working Together

Whether you require a prototype to evaluate a concept, a dataset to support research, assistance with private network deployment, or guidance on radio intelligence, we provide practical engineering support tailored to your RF requirements.
